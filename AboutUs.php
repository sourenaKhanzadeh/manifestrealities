      <h1>About Us:</h1>
      <p> Hello! Welcome to ManifestRealities.com My name is AJ. I've studied the law of
        attraction for many-many years now and feel that this amazing phenomenon
        <p>
          should be shared with others. This is why I started this website and launched on other
        </p>
        <p>
          platforms alike. Manifest Realities is actually quite a recent project of mine. Originally created on December of 2018!
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah very recent lol
        I had this sudden feeling to launch now, and it was a very strong feeling. Nothing like your average sunday.
      </p>
      So! With that said and done. I hope you check out everything I've got to offer and may it help you in your journey of life.  </p>
